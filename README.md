# CSV Validator

.NET Core CSV text file validator. Enables the quick verification of column seperated data files. Columns can be 
checked against multiple requirements for correctness.

## Usage

The application is command line based, and has two arguments:

``` bash
formatvalidator -config "configuration.json" -validate "input-datafile.csv"
```

## Configuration

To configure the verification a JSON file is used with the following format:

``` json
{
	"rowSeperator": "\r\n",
	"columnSeperator": ",",
	"columns": {
		"1": {
			"name": "ID",
			"isRequired": true,
			"isUnique": true
		},
		"2": {
			"name": "DOB",
			"pattern": "^\\d\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d-\\d\\d$"
		},
		"3": {
			"name": "NOTES",
			"maxLength": "250"
		}
	}
}
```

The "pattern" property uses regular expressions but it is important to escape the characters else the application will 
fail when reading the configuration file.

"rowSeperator" can be any number of characters, rows can also be seperated by characters and do not need the new line characters to 
be available in the input file.

"columnSeperator" can be one or more characters.

The columns require the number, which is the ordinal of the column in the input file, you do not need to specify all columns, 
only those that are to be validated.
